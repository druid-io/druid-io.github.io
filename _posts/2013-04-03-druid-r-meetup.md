On April 3rd 2013 we held our first Meetup hosted by Metamarkets. The description and video follows. 

####[Meetup Description](https://github.com/metamx/RDruid)
Since Metamarkets open-sourced Druid, our real-time analytics database, it’s
been used within many different industries outside the online advertising space
(gaming, on-line entertainment, enterprise CRM). Our community is growing but
none so fast and as vocal as the R community.

Outside of our production environment, Metamarkets leverages Druid for research - query and drill down on extremely large data sets in order to provide insight
on everything from internal metrics to customer usage patterns. As the key
sponsor and creator of Druid, our data scientists rely on the combination of R
and Druid for developing analytics to serve customers in online advertising.

In response to the interest we recently decided to open source our [R connector
for Druid](https://github.com/metamx/RDruid) and we thought we'd create a Meetup
to show you how we've successfully used this powerful combination. Please join
us for our first Open Druid user group at our new office, bring your laptops
and learn how to query large data sets in Druid with our recently open sourced
Druid R connector.
