In February we were honored to speak at the O’Reilly Strata conference about
building a robust, flexible, and completely open source data analytics stack.
If you couldn’t make it, you can watch the [video
here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJMYVpnW_AQ). Preparing for our talk got
us thinking about all the brilliant folks working on similar problems, so we
organized a panel that same night to continue the conversation.

The discussion featured key contributors to several open source technologies:
Andy Feng ([Storm](http://storm.incubator.apache.org/)), Eric Tschetter
([Druid](http://druid.io/)), Jun Rao ([Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/)), and
Matei Zaharia ([Spark](http://spark.apache.org/)). It was moderated by
VentureBeat Staff Writer Jordan Novet and hosted by Zack Bogue of the [Founders
Den](http://www.foundersden.com/) and [Data Collective](http://dcvc.com/).

To a packed house, Andy emphasized the importance of building a strong
community around open source projects while Eric addressed big data uses cases
and the challenges inherent in working with open source technologies. Jun
shared his thoughts on the potential for a future generic data analytics stack
and Matei spoke about the advantages of building a company using Spark and the
benefits of “riding the Hadoop wave.” Watch the video and check out the slides.

Thanks to Zack, Jordan, all the panelists, and everyone who attended for
sharing their knowledge with the community. We look forward to seeing you at
the next one!

In the meantime, you can catch the Druid team on the road this summer. We’re
speaking at a handful of conferences including
[Gluecon](http://www.gluecon.com/2014/speakers/) on May 22 in Denver, CO, [ACM
SIGMOD](http://www.sigmod2014.org/program_sigmod.shtml#ind2) in Snowbird, UT on
June 24, and
[Oscon](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/34076) in
Portland, OR on July 23.
