We're excited to announce the general availability of our latest release, [Druid 0.9.1.1](/downloads.html)!

Druid 0.9.1.1 contains hundreds of performance improvements, stability improvements, and bug fixes
over the previous 0.9.0 release, from over 30 contributors. Major new features include an
experimental Kafka indexing service to support exactly-once consumption from Apache Kafka, support
for cluster-wide query-time lookups (QTL), and an improved segment balancing algorithm.
