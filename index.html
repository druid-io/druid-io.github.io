        <h3>Sub-Second Queries</h3>
        <p>
          Druid supports fast aggregations and sub-second OLAP queries. Druid is designed for
          multi-tenancy and is ideal for powering user-facing analytic applications. 
        </p>

        <span class="fa fa-feed fa"></span><br>
        <h3>Real-time Streams</h3>
        <p>
          Druid supports streaming data ingestion and offers insights on events
          immediately after they occur. Retain events indefinitely and 
          unify real-time and historical views.
        </p>

        <span class="fa fa-database fa"></span><br>
        <h3>Scalable to Petabytes</h3>
        <p>
          Existing Druid clusters have scaled to petabytes of data and
          trillions of events, ingesting millions of events every second. Druid is
          extremely cost effective, even at scale. 
        </p>

        <span class="fa fa-gears fa"></span><br>
        <h3>Deploy Anywhere</h3>
        <p>
          Druid runs on commodity hardware. Deploy it in the cloud or
          on-premise. Integrate with existing data systems such as
          Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Storm, and Samza.
