          <h5>Analyze event streams</h5>
          <p>
            Druid provides fast analytical queries, at high concurrency, on both real-time and historical data. Druid is often used to power interactive UIs.

          <h5>Utilize reimagined architecture</h5>
          <p>
            Druid is a new class of data store that combines ideas from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing'>OLAP/analytic databases</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series_database'>timeseries databases</a>, and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-text_search'>search systems</a> to enable new use cases with streaming and batch data.

          <h5>Build next generation data stacks</h5>
          <p>
            Druid integrates natively with message buses (Kafka, AWS Kinesis, etc) and data lakes (HDFS, AWS S3, etc). Druid works especially well as a query layer for streaming data architectures.

          <h5>Unlock new workflows</h5>
          <p>
            Druid is built for rapid, ad-hoc analytics on both real-time and historical data. Explain trends, explore data, and quickly iterate on queries to answer questions.

          <h5>Deploy anywhere</h5>
          <p>
            Druid can be deployed in any *NIX environment on commodity hardware, both in the cloud and on premise. Druid is cloud-native: scaling up and down is as simple as adding and removing processes.

      Disclaimer: Apache Druid is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator.
      Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
      While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
