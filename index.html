          <h5>Analyze event streams</h5>
          <p>
            Druid provides fast analytical queries, at high concurrency, on both historical and real-time data. Druid is often used to power interactive UIs.

          <h5>Build next generation data architecture</h5>
          <p>
            Druid works out-of-the-box with data lakes (HDFS, AWS S3, etc) and message buses (Kafka, AWS Kinesis, etc). Druid is used as a query layer in next-gen streaming and batch data stacks.

          <h5>Unlock new workflows</h5>
          <p>
            Druid is designed for rapid, ad-hoc analytics on both real-time and historical data. Explain trends, explore data, and quickly iterate on queries to answer questions.

          <h5>Deploy anywhere</h5>
          <p>
            Druid can be deployed in any *nix environment on commodity hardware, both in the cloud and on premise. Druid is cloud-native: scaling up and down is as simple as adding and removing processes.

      Disclaimer: Apache Druid is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator.
      Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
      While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
