        Overview
      </h2>
      <p>
Druid is primarily used to store, query, and analyze large event streams. Examples of event streams include user generated data such as clickstreams, application generated data such as performance metrics, and machine generated data such as network flows and server metrics. Druid is optimized for sub-second queries to slice-and-dice, drill down, search, filter, and aggregate this data. Druid is commonly used to power interactive applications where performance, concurrency, and uptime are important.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
Druid was initially created to power a scalable, visual, multi-tenant application where users could not only rapidly slice and dice data to create ad-hoc reports, but also interactively explore data to quickly determine the root cause of patterns and anomalies. Druid is designed from the ground up for sub-second queries, which are critical in interactive applications as <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/">usability studies</a> have shown that humans get distracted and lose their train of thought if responses take longer than a second.
      </p>
      <p>
Reference architectures with Druid often combine the system with a message bus such as <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a> to form an end-to-end streaming analytics solution. In such a setup, Kafka streams messages to Druid, and Druid enables interactive queries to store, analyze, and investigate this data. Druid can also be combined with a data lake such as <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html">HDFS</a> for batch-oriented workloads.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Design
      </h2>
      <p>
        Druid’s core design combines ideas from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing">OLAP/analytic databases</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series_database">timeseries databases</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-text_search">search systems</a> to create a unified system for operational analytics. Core design ideas include:

        <div class="feature">
          <span class="fa fa-columns fa"></span>
          <h5>Column-oriented storage</h5>
          <p>
            Druid stores and compresses each column individually, and only needs to read the ones needed for a particular query, which supports fast scans, rankings, and groupBys.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
          <span class="fa fa-search fa"></span>
          <h5>Native search indexes</h5>
          <p>
            Druid creates inverted indexes for string values for fast search and filter.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
          <span class="fa fa-tint fa"></span>
          <h5>Streaming and batch ingest</h5>
          <p>
            Out-of-the-box connectors for Apache Kafka, HDFS, AWS S3, stream processors, and more.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
          <span class="fa fa-stream fa"></span>
          <h5>Flexible schemas</h5>
          <p>
            Druid gracefully handles evolving schemas and <a href="/docs/latest/ingestion/flatten-json">nested data</a>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
          <span class="fa fa-clock fa"></span>
          <h5>Time-optimized partitioning</h5>
          <p>
            Druid intelligently partitions data based on time and time-based queries are significantly faster than traditional databases.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
          <span class="fa fa-align-left fa"></span>
          <h5>SQL support</h5>
          <p>
            In addition to its native <a href="/docs/latest/querying/querying">JSON based language</a>, Druid speaks <a href="/docs/latest/querying/sql">SQL</a> over either HTTP or JDBC.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
          <span class="fa fa-expand fa"></span>
          <h5>Horizontally scalable</h5>
          <p>
            Druid has been <a href="druid-powered">used in production</a> to ingest millions of events/sec, retain years of data, and provide sub-second queries.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
          <span class="fa fa-balance-scale fa"></span>
          <h5>Easy to operate</h5>
          <p>
            Scale up or down by just adding or removing servers, and Druid automatically rebalances. Fault-tolerant architecture routes around server failures.
