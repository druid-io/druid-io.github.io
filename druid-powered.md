There are numerous companies of various sizes in production with Druid. This list is incomplete and we hope to add everyone's use cases in the near future.

## Archive-It.org

Druid is used to power dynamic analytics and charting in Archive-It Reports. Reports help Archive-It partners understand what content they captured, why some content did not get captured, and assists with quality assurance and crawl scoping to ensure they are building the highest quality collections.

## Criteo

Criteo is using druid to provide its customers with user-centric analytics & reporting. 
With more than 1 billion unique users reached per month, 3 billion ads displayed per day, and a 70% growth in 2014, Criteo's previous stack was hard pressed keeping with the load. Replacing it with druid helped us achieved linear scalability while letting our customers explore their data in new and interactive ways.

## DripStat

DripStat uses Druid as a timeseries database to power the DripStat GUI. DripStat ingests transactional data for Java, Scala, and Groovy applications into Druid.

## eBay

eBay uses Druid to aggregate multiple data streams for real-time user behavior analytics by ingesting up at a very high rate(over 100,000 events/sec), with the ability to query or aggregate data by any random combination of dimensions, and support over 100 concurrent queries without impacting ingest rate and query latencies.

## GumGum

Druid powers a dashboard used internally to visualize real-time analytics on GumGum's Real Time Bidding platform. GumGum runs Druid on Amazon EC2 and can ingest up to 300,000 events per second at peak time.

## Jolata

Jolata leverages Druid as the analytics data store for the realtime network perfomance managment platform. Injesting over 35 billion events per day, Jolata calculates a billion metrics every minute to visualize precise network metrics in real-time, and enable operators to quickly drill down and perform root cause analysis.

## LDMobile

LDMobile is a mobile DSP for the RTB. We use Druid to aggregate some metrics in order to propose to our customers a real-time dashboard showing performance indicators of their campaigns.

## LiquidM

LiquidM uses Druid for real-time drill-down reporting. LiquidM is also contributing back to the community by creating and maintaining a ruby client library for interacting with Druid located at <http://github.com/liquidm/ruby-druid>.

## Metamarkets
Druid is the primary data store for Metamarkets’ full stack visual analytics
service for the RTB (real time bidding) space. Ingesting over 30 billion events
per day, Metamarkets is able to provide insight to its customers using complex
ad-hoc queries at a 95th percentile query time of around 1 second.

## N3twork

N3TWORK uses Druid for real-time analysis of its Internet of Interests social
entertainment network. It uses Druid analytics both to optimize user
experiences and to guide the evolution of its product.

## Netflix

Netflix engineers use Druid to aggregate multiple data streams, ingesting up to
two terabytes per hour, with the ability to query data as its being ingested.
They use Druid to pinpoint anomalies within their infrastructure, endpoint
activity and content flow.

## Paypal

The Druid production deployment at PayPal processes a very large volume of data
and is used for internal exploratory analytics by business analytic teams. Here
is what they have to say:

> Around early Feb, 2014, the Paypal Tracking Platform team, lead by Suresh Kumar, stumbled upon an article talking about a new
> upcoming kid in Real Time Analytics world. After first glance it seemed just like any other
> new cool looking technology. But after reading little deeper into the papers(they had
> referred) and few blogs, it was clear it is different. The fundamental approach to query
> the data itself looked very different and refreshing.
>
> Coincidently, at the same time, the team was struggling to create a very high volume real-time data
> query system. We had already explored Drill, Hive, Cassandra, TSDB, Shark etc.
> Dating back at least a year, none of these technologies were fulfilling our low latency needs for very high
> volumes of data.
>
> So, as an option we started the Druid prototype and within couple of weeks it was looking like
> a very promising alternate. Very soon with great help from Core Druid development team
> our prototype was doing great.
>
> We then started the prototype with large 7-10 billion records and see the response time for
> query. It was quite amazing.
>
> Today our Druid implementation in PayPal processes a very large volume of Data and is
> used for our internal exploratory analytics by business analytic teams.
>
> The thing we liked the most was amazing support provided by core Druid team. I have never
> seen a Open Source Community providing such a very high level of responsiveness for ANY
> issue related to Druid setup and tuning.
