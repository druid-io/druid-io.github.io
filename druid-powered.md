## Paypal

The Druid production deployment at PayPal processes a very large volume of data
and is used for internal exploratory analytics by business analytic teams. Here
is what they have to say:

> Around early Feb, 2014, the Paypal Tracking Platform team, lead by Suresh Kumar, stumbled upon an article talking about a new
> upcoming kid in Real Time Analytics world. After first glance it seemed just like any other
> new cool looking technology. But after reading little deeper into the papers(they had
> referred) and few blogs, it was clear it is different. The fundamental approach to query
> the data itself looked very different and refreshing.
>
> Coincidently, at the same time, the team was struggling to create a very high volume real-time data
> query system. We had already explored Drill, Hive, Cassandra, TSDB, Shark etc.
> Dating back at least a year, none of these technologies were fulfilling our low latency needs for very high
> volumes of data.
>
> So, as an option we started the Druid prototype and within couple of weeks it was looking like
> a very promising alternate. Very soon with great help from Core Druid development team
> our prototype was doing great.
>
> We then started the prototype with large 7-10 billion records and see the response time for
> query. It was quite amazing.
>
> Today our Druid implementation in PayPal processes a very large volume of Data and is
> used for our internal exploratory analytics by business analytic teams.
>
> The thing we liked the most was amazing support provided by core Druid team. I have never
> seen a Open Source Community providing such a very high level of responsiveness for ANY
> issue related to Druid setup and tuning.
